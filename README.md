# Intelligent-Waste-Management-System
EcoSort is a smart waste management system that categorizes waste into wet and dry types, monitors waste levels, and notifies collectors via an Android app when the bin is full. The system uses a GPS module for location tracking, a Firebase database for real-time data synchronization, and various other sensors for waste classification and bin level monitoring. It enables a prompt response when the bin is full, thereby preventing overflow and maintaining cleanliness. This system plays a significant role in fostering sustainability.
